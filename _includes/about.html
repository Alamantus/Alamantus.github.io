                        I currently work full time at Inquisicorp, but I am available for freelance projects. I love building new projects and helping make peoples&rsquo; visions for their websites a reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My rates are <strong>$50 per hour</strong> for building the project and implementing new features and <strong>$20 per hour</strong> for consultation after the project is complete in case you need help adding new features yourself.

                    I pride myself in writing clean, readable code, and always aim to create the lightest and tidiest projects possible. When I build a new project, my goal is to make it understandable to clients who have some level of coding experience so they can make any changes they need to.

                        I&rsquo;m a hobby game developer, a linguistics enthusaist, a conlang creator, a home owner, a dog parent, and a casual gamer.

                        While the games I have created have mainly been the result of short-term game jams, I've had a great time building them. I focus not only on video games but also tabletop and role-playing games! The majority of my games are available on <a href="https://alamantus.itch.io" target="_blank">my Itch.io page</a>. I also write about game development and the like on my <a href="http://alamantus.com" target="_blank">Alamantus blog/website</a> and on my <a href="https://boardgames.social/@Alamantus" target="_blank">account at the boardgames.social Mastodon instance</a>.

                    <p>
                        I have also been developing the <a href="http://gutsplus.tk" target="_blank">GUTS+ System</a>, a role-playing game system that uses an ever-expanding pool of stats and stat points for characters and fairly simple six-sided dice rolls for determining success. It is a heavily narrative-based system that focuses more on progressing a story than on combat, and while the rulebooks aren&rsquo;t fully written yet, the system itself is technically usable!

                        In addition to my game development, I also develop constructed languages (conlangs), and I keep a <a href="https://blog.lexicon.ga" target="_blank">blog attached to Lexiconga tool</a> that posts and reblogs conlang ideas and inspiration. I also write about linguistics and conlanging on my <a href="https://spooky.pizza/@Alamantus" target="_blank">account at the spooky.pizza Mastodon instance</a>.

                        I haven&rsquo;t &ldquo;completed&rdquo; a conlang yet, but I have several publicly visible:

                    I&rsquo;m also on Github as <a href="https://github.com/Alamantus" target="_blank">Alamantus</a>, Reddit as <a href="https://reddit.com/user/alamantus" target="_blank">Alamantus</a>, and even Keybase as <a href="https://keybase.io/alamantus" target="_blank">alamantus</a>. Nearly everywhere you see the name &ldquo;Alamantus&rdquo; on the internet, it will likely be me. I&rsquo;m also pretty sure that I&rsquo;m the only &ldquo;Robbie Antenesse&rdquo; alive on earth, so if you search for my name and something comes up, it&rsquo;s <em>probably</em> me.
