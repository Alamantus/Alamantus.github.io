  ### Professionally...

  I'm a web developer who specializes in JavaScript front end development and PHP + MySQL back end development with a
  growing interest in NodeJS back end apps.

  My experience with JavaScript includes a number of popular tools and frameworks like Webpack, React, Redux,
  jQuery, and more and some less popular ones that I prefer like Parcel Bundler, Choo, and Inferno JS.
  I pride myself in the fact that the depth of my JavaScript knowledge enables me to quickly learn any new frameworks
  or libraries that I might be required to learn in any given situation.

  While I am primarily focused on front end development, most of my work requires a back end, so I have collected a
  lot of experience in that realm as well. My back end experience includes a variety of technologies like plain
  object-oriented PHP, NodeJS, Apache & NginX, custom databases & SQL, and more. These technologies have exposed me
  to tools like Composer, FlightPHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Express JS, Fastify JS, Certbot and much more.
