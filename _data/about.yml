  ### Professionally...

  I'm a web developer who specializes in JavaScript front end development and PHP + MySQL back end development with a
  growing interest in NodeJS back end apps.

  My experience with JavaScript includes a number of popular tools and frameworks like Webpack, React, Redux,
  jQuery, and more and some less popular ones that I prefer like Parcel Bundler, Choo, and Inferno JS.
  I pride myself in the fact that the depth of my JavaScript knowledge enables me to quickly learn any new frameworks
  or libraries that I might be required to learn in any given situation.

  While I am primarily focused on front end development, most of my work requires a back end, so I have collected a
  lot of experience in that realm as well. My back end experience includes a variety of technologies like plain
  object-oriented PHP, NodeJS, Apache & NginX, custom databases & SQL, and more. These technologies have exposed me
  to tools like Composer, FlightPHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Express JS, Fastify JS, Certbot and much more.

  ### Personally...

  I'm a hobby game developer, linguistics enthusiast, conlang creator, home owner, dog parent, and casual gamer.

  I create games for both the computer and the tabletop. Most of the computer games I've made have been the results
  of short-term game jams, but the tabletop games have generally been longer term projects driven by passion.
  The majority of my games are available on [my Itch.io page](https://alamantus.itch.io), and I also keep a my
  now-dormant [game development advice and inspiration blog](https://alamantus.com) online as something of an
  archive of its valuable information and encouragement. I also have a Mastodon account where I write about
  games in general and share interesting things I find on [Tabletop.Social](https://tabletop.social/@Alamantus).

  Other from games, I also develop constructed languages (conlangs) and keep a [blog for Lexiconga](https://blog.lexicon.ga)
  that posts and reblogs conlang ideas and inspiration. I have yet another Mastodon account on [Polyglot.City](https://polyglot.city/@Alamantus)
  where I post about linguistics, conlanging, and the occasional Biblical Hebrew translation.

  I'm on GitHub as [Alamantus](https://github.com/Alamantus), Reddit as [Alamantus](https://reddit.com/user/alamantus),
  and even Keybase as [alamantus](https://keybase.io/alamantus), and I'm pretty sure that I'm the only
  "Robbie Antenesse" alive on earth. If you search the web for either "Robbie Antenesse" or "Alamantus", the
  results will most likely be related to me in some way!
