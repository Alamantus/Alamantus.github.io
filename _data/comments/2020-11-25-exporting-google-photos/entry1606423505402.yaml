message: "Hi Robbie, very useful post! Being the lazy guy I am, I wanted something easier and Googled around. I found a tool called SyncBackPro which, among things connects with your Google Photos and downloads everything to your local drive, no Zipping.  I discovered I had about 29GB of images and video and it took 18 hours to download over my supposedly 40mbps broadband connection.\r\n\r\nYou don't get any albums but all the images and video organized by year ans month in separate folders.\r\n\r\nSyncBackPro is free for a 30 day trial. I got what I needed. :-)\r\n\r\nLest you think I am the developer or a paid shill: I am an old retired dude with no agenda. I have no connection with the vendor.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMurli"
