message: "I found that if even the folder name is good the timestamps of the photos in it is not correct. I had to make a small script to change the timestamps of the photos from folders. I did that because when I uploaded to my nas the photos were shown in wrong timeline. \r\nhttps://github.com/ndegnpai/google-photos-date-changer\r\nThis is my first project on GitHub. Be nice."
