# Robbie Antenesse's Portfolio Site

This is a Jekyll site using Picnic CSS. It uses Jekyll because it's hosted on GitHub Pages, and I want it to be as easy to manage as possible just in case I need to change any text content.

## Note to Future Robbie

If you're installing this on a new computer or if you update Picnic, just run `yarn` to install it, and then copy the `node_modules/picnic` folder into `_sass` before committing and pushing to GitHub Pages!
