Radio Silence is an interactive experience created in collaboration with [Paws Menu](http://pawsmenu.net)
created for the 2016 Fermi Paradox Jam. In this game, you gaze through a telescope and send messages to
the stars from your computer terminal in hopes that you might receive a reply. While stargazing, you can
also scan the radio for some ethereal music and even a radio show voiced by myself and some other voice
actors credited in the game.

It was built using C# in Unity 3D, Blender, and Heroku, which hosts the API and database that
stores messages sent to stars and retrieves them if they are ever scanned.
