Lexiconga is a free tool that makes it fast and easy go build dictionaries for constructed
languages. It takes an offline-first approach to handling dictionary data, storing it
exclusively in the user's browser and only calling the server when they log in with an account.
All functionality is available without an account, and without an account, all
functionality is available offline using [UpUp](https://www.talater.com/upup/).

It is built with vanilla JavaScript, Sass styling, a straight PHP backend and a MySQL server,
and it is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/Alamantus/Lexiconga).
