Designed and built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas using my [OversimplifiedJS](https://github.com/Alamantus/OversimplifiedJS)
game engine in 14 days for the [2016 LOWREZJAM](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016)
and updated incrementally.

### Lessons

Dug deep into JavaScript objects to understand how they worked and what their limitations
are to their core. Worked with nesting and recursion to get data to flow and display
correctly within my [OversimplifiedJS](https://github.com/Alamantus/OversimplifiedJS) game
engine, and dramatically improved the collision detection algorithm.
 
Because of the harsh size limitations imposed by the game jam, I learned how to utilize
the available screen space as well as possible, and overcame the problems that not being
able to see long distances within the game could potentially cause.

I could have improved the game by adding more indications of how to play more effectively,
but time did not allow this. The way I separated my code within the game engine also hurt
the experience, because sometimes the game does not load on the first try when you open
the pageâ€”I should have combined all of the code into one file so it would not have been a
problem.
