Designed and built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas in 7 days for fun and updated incrementally
to easily make small web games.

### Process

On November 15, 2014, I decided that I wanted to try to create a JavaScript game engine,
so I started building a library to do so. I researched how to make JavaScript draw to and
update HTML5 canvas elements, and after about 7 days, I had a working prototype finished.
As I learned more about how JavaScript works and how to utilize JavaScript objects and make
more efficient functions, I gradually improved the game engine as I created games.

The development process of [Trade Winds](https://alamantus.itch.io/trade-winds) helped drive
major improvement and optimization for OversimplifiedJS.

### Lessons

Building and using this project taught me a lot of the inner workings and quirks of JavaScript.
I learned all about JavaScript objects and how nested objects and functions work. I was also
able to learn how to load files into a global variable and how to use audio and other HTML5
elements.
