The GUTS+ System is a role-playing game system that provides rules for playing in any setting
you want with characters that aren't necessarily super powerful. GUTS+ aims to have easy to
remember rules, an emphasis on role play, and a unique character quality system that highlights
your characters' individual strengths rather than a collection of generic stats. The rules are
available for free online, but you can also buy a nicely formatted PDF version of the rules from
[Itch.io](https://alamantus.itch.io/guts-plus) and [DriveThru RPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273132/The-GUTS-System-Core-Rule-Book).

The website that hosts the rules and all the information about the system is built to be as light
on bandwidth as possible while still implementing an attractive style framework. All told, the
website serves less than 70kb of bandwidth per page, and it also stores an offline version of
the rules in the user's browser just in case they ever visit without internet access. It also
implements an instance of Matomo analytics, which tracks pageviews and leaves user data anonymous.

It is hosted on GitLab pages and is built using the Hugo templating engine.
