A personal portfolio website using simple HTML5, jQuery, and [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) style framework

### Process

I wanted to keep this project simple, so I decided to only make what was needed: A single HTML page, a single
JavaScript file for jQuery control, and a CSS style framework to make things look nice without unnecessary struggle.
I chose this structure so I could easily modify files and upload it right back with FTP if any quick tweaks are needed
without worrying about using a computer that has the tools I need to transpile the data into a usable web file.

Working with Kelsie, I was able to get all of her information from her resume and CV to fill out the data on the site
using a nice, easy-to-follow structure, and got all of the data online quickly. I also utilized a contact form service
to set up a simple contact form without needing to do any extra back-end coding.

### Lessons

I learned that while it is in some cases easier to go for a simple one-file website, managing that file can get out
of hand quickly if there is a lot of data. Using tools to handle and display data in a simpler way is very nice, but
it's also nice to know that the output is your own, not generated by a transpiler. This makes the file easy to read
and work with, even if there is a lot of scrolling involved.
