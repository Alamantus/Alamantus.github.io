A simple but powerful product selection customizer for Sonlight's curriculum package sets.

### Process

When I began working at Inquisicorp Corp., I was asked to start working on an application that
would allow customers to change the products within pre-built curriculum packages provided by
Sonlight, a child company of Inquisicorp Corp. I was told that I could use any method I wanted
while building it, so I chose to use a modern ReactJS+Webpack stack to build it. I believed that
what needed to be accomplished would best be done using these tools because of ReactJS's ability
to alter displayed data quickly based on user input.

Throughout the process, I built the Package Builder to be simply a display portal that could
handle and correctly display any data that was provided to it from an API managed by a coworker
so long as the data was in an expected format. I also accommodated several design changes from
our designer in order to fit better with the overall website design. As I built the application,
my skill with ReactJS and JSX improved dramatically, and I went back to rewrite old code several
times as I was making changes.

### Lessons

I learned that making sure your code is orderly and easy to maintain is the most important thing
that you can do. This was my first long-term professional project, so I needed to make sure I
could juggle everything that needed to be done with knowing how and where to make any changes
that were asked on the spur of the moment.
