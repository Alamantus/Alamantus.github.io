RedFlag is a free tool that allows users to mark any link with up to three different
content warnings and provides a link to use in the original link's place that displays
the selected warnings so viewers can choose whether they want to see the content or not.
It also provides a way to add your own warnings if the one you are looking for is not
on the included list, but it only sticks around if more than one person uses the same
warning in a set period of time.

It is built with PHP, jQuery, and SQLite, and it is [open source on GitHub](https://github.com/Alamantus/RedFlag).
