A simple but effective way to responsibly share links about or containing potentially sensitive subjects.

### Process

My wife told me about an article that was posted on social media about a dog that was
murdered. The article featured a photo of the dog, and overall it was a disturbing and
alarming experience. I wanted to make a web app that would allow someone to share a link
but warn people about sensitive content that might be on the link's page, so I looked
into how I could alias a web address to show an alternate image that warns the audience
about what content was on the page.

I used PHP to blah blah blah and SQLite to blah blah blah, plus jQuery yadda yadda.

### Lessons

This was my first time using classes in PHP's object oriented structure, and I found
it very useful. I tried to utilize classes as much as I could to keep my code as structured
and separated as possible.

Using a pseudo-MVC structure, I was able to separate my code
in a healthy way, keeping the text itself separate from the container that displayed
the text made it possible to keep terminology completely consistent across the site,
and separating the code that controlled the website's behavior from the code that displayed
the content made it easier to find and fix bugs and add new features.
