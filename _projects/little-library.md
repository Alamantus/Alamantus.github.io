Little Library is a web service that aims to create the experience of a [Little Free Library](https://littlefreelibrary.org/)
in a digital space. It allows users to upload ebooks that they want to share with others with a
reason why they want to share the book, and when another viewer claims the file, it is permanently
deleted from the server, emulating the act of taking the book from a Little Free Library shelf. In
this way, it is essentially the same as sharing the book with a friend because it works with just one
copy at a time. It also displays a history of previously downloaded books to preserve what the original
uploader wrote about the book!

It is built with Node on an Express server, served from a Google Cloud virtual machine, and it is
[open source on GitHub](https://github.com/Alamantus/little-library).
