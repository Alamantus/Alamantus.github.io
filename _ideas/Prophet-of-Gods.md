A management game where you walk around a desert telling people the will of your god while providing blessings or inflicting curses on the people for how they act.

The places you visit are dynamically-sized and based on the size of the village and their temperament, they will serve different gods. If you encounter a god that is more powerful than your god, you can switch allegiances to get different abilities. Each god is generated with a set of desires and hates, and you must make sure people serving that god are following them, whipping them into shape as needed, creating a balancing act of keeping the gods, the people, and yourself happy.
