Yesterday, my wife and I closed on our new house. That's right, it's official: we have a mortgage! And also a nice house to live in! We have been living in apartments for 5 years, and my new job has finally allowed us to move up to American homeownership. As stressful as having a mortgage is, it is truly delightful to have a place to call our own! We even have a yard for the dogs to play in, plus the previous owners left a ton of yard equipment and other appliances for us so we don't have to buy our own!

Today, a bunch of our friends helped us move out of our third-floor apartment, and I can't express how helpful it was. It saved us a boatload of money and it made the whole process go incredibly fast! We had everything out of the apartment and into the house in about 4 or 5 hours! Amazing! We got a 16-foot moving truck from Budget, and we were able to fit everything in that truck and some of the more delicate stuff into a few of our friends' cars. It ended up being a lot of fun, too, because we all hung out afterward and ate pizza and chatted.

Some friends stayed even later and went to dinner with us! It was amazing that everything went off without a hitch, and I am so glad.
