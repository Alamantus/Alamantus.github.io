A [good friend of mine](https://github.com/descartez) and I are working on setting up [a blog](https://descartez.github.io/wth_is)
using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) + [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and it has been a thoroughly wonderful
experience for me. Jekyll is a site generator that takes a particular file structure, some markdown files, and a bit of
cleverness, chews it all up, and spits out a website full of HTML files! And Github Pages allows you to serve those files
completely free.

I fell in love the moment I learned that Github even generates the Jekyll site for you.

Anyway, I've had this website sitting in a corner doing nothing for the longest time, trying to figure out not only what
to put on it but also what to use to build it. I was trying to do something super complicated to show my skills, but I realized
that would be what the portfolio's _contents_ should be for, not necessarily the site showcasing that content.

So I found a nice website template, modified it to do what I wanted, and uploaded my Jekyll project. The result is what you
see before you! A nice, tidy website with some content to showcase what I'm proud of, _plus_ an extra blog, to boot!

Not bad. Not bad at all.
